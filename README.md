# Mariah's Portfolio!
I'm happy to share my code! Shoot me a message if you have questions or comments, thanks for visiting :)

My portfolio is based on a vuetify theme to help me follow best practices, but has all been reworked and hopefully improved upon by me.

### Quick Start
Unzip the `vue-portfolio.zip` file into any directory.

```bash
cd path/to/project
yarn # or npm install
yarn serve # or npm run serve
```
