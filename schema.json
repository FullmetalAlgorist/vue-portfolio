It’s essential to prioritize small screens, but that doesn’t mean ignoring desktop and tablet users. With a fully responsive layout, my websites are designed to scale up beautifully (try my profile on any device!)  With different assets and layouts for different screen sizes."

I use animations and transitions to make web interaction more dynamic and therefore more enjoyable, stress free and memorable for any technical skill level. Efficiency in some areas needs to be maintained but if a user interacting with your website feels engaged and entertained they are more likely to stay for longer and possibly come back again for more."

We’re just starting to understand its potential to describe all sorts of shapes and curves found in nature.  It’s patent pending, but for now we can do what we want with it.  I decided to duplicate it in processing to make it more accessible to play with. ",

I ported this from Daniel Shiffman’s processing examples. (Thanks Daniel!)",
