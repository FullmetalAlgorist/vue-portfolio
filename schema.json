      "summary": "In 2018 58% of all web traffic came from mobile phones, and studies show that number steadily rising!  It’s essential to prioritize small screens, but that doesn’t mean ignoring desktop and tablet users. With a fully responsive layout, my websites are designed to scale up beautifully (try my profile on any device!)  With different assets and layouts for different screen sizes."

I use animations and transitions to make web interaction more dynamic and therefore more enjoyable, stress free and memorable for any technical skill level. Efficiency in some areas needs to be maintained but if a user interacting with your website feels engaged and entertained they are more likely to stay for longer and possibly come back again for more."

I try to make my websites a break from the business of the web and our lives, where information is presented as needed in a calming attractive fashion."

We’re just starting to understand its potential to describe all sorts of shapes and curves found in nature.  It’s patent pending, but for now we can do what we want with it.  I decided to duplicate it in processing to make it more accessible to play with. ",

Sine waves occur naturally all around us, and are another of my favorite geometric forms to play with.",

We start with a single trunk that splits into two branches, each of those branches in turn splits in to another two, and so on to infinity! (Or when I tell it to stop). I ported this from Daniel Shiffman’s processing examples. (Thanks Daniel!)",

      "text": "Emergence is the idea that a system does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another.  This can have implications throughout the universe, but is most easily visualized in particle systems. Here we have a bunch of vertexes floating through space connecting with lines when they get close enough, and responsive to mouse movement-There is a lot of math going on constantly behind the scenes here... If things start to slow down, just refresh the page to start with a clean slate",
